# Dine Restaurant Website

![Design preview for the Dine Website Challenge coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

I created this website as part of a challenge from Frontend Mentor.
It basically is a template of what I could deliver as a website for a restaurant since all the code was written by me. The design and layout was provided by a Figma file included with the challenge.

### Throughout this project

I add the chance to learn about:

- The basics of Figma for developers

I practiced using:

- React
- SCSS

I spiced it up adding:

- Typescript
